gprint is a Python module that allows to print color on almost any terminal.


## How to import

```python
from gprint import *
```

## Usage

```python
gprint(message, rgb, new_line, rainbow_mode, return_me)
```
message         = String with the text to be printed.

rgb             = A list of 3 Integers from 0 to 255 that represents every color on rgb scale, a color code (RED, BLUE....) can be used too. Defaults to "default" (white text).

new_line        = A boolean that represents if you want a new line after the printed text or not. Defaults to True.

rainbow_mode    = A boolean that allows the command to print every character from a pseudo-randomized color. Defaults to False.

return_me       = A boolean that allows to return of the colorized text instead of printing it directly (useful for other commands like input() ). Defaults to False.
